## Video Retrieval Search Engine

*The Internet is an inevitable thing in our life and is a great source of information. This information can be found using a variety of search engines. The image retrieval capability of today's search engines, which allows us to search using photos, has brought about a revolutionary development in the Internet world. But right now, there is no such search engine that can do the same thing with videos. Therefore, our project aims to develop a video retrieval search engine. We plan to develop this project using image processing technology. The approach is similar to that of image retrieval, but in video retrieval, we take each image, i.e., each shot of the video, and analyze the contents of the video, such as the texts included, colors, and so on. The hardware and software requirements include GPU for video processing, and network connectivity for searching databases over the internet. In conclusion, the proposed system will give users an effective approach to searching for videos and make it simpler to find video sources.*
